# NOTES
1.The Text rendering is done in freetype I have used the code from 
https://learnopengl.com/code_viewer_gh.php?code=src/7.in_practice/2.text_rendering/text_rendering.cpp

NOTE: The text rendering part is not original code 

2.The Font uses absolute path,so you need to modify it if you are running in your computer
It is main.cpp
